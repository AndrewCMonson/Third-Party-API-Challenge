# Third-Party-API-Challenge

## Overview of Project
The intention of this project was to build an interactive schedule/workday calendar using jQuery, JS, HTML, and Bootstrap CSS

## Provided Information

### User Story
```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Instructions
You can access this application here: https://andrewcmonson.github.io/Third-Party-API-Challenge/

This is intended to be used as a daily calendar that persists and tracks time through your workday. As of release, you can only reset the entire calendar at once, not individual time blocks. This may be implemented in the future if revisited.
